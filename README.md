# 📁 DiscSplit - Split & Merge Files for Discord

⚡ **Splits large files into Discord-friendly chunks**
🔗 **Merges chunks back into original files**
🪓 **Bypasses Discord's 10MB file limit**
💻 **Written in C**

`Why in C?` - I wanted to practice file managament and test my hard skills in C!

### 🔥Motivation

Obviously, my first reason to code this project is **to bypass the Discord's file limit** because I faced this issue myself. Plus, I've already said earlier that I wanted to test my "C" skills, especially with files. In addition, I want to learn CMake (it will be added later, that's goal №1!)

### 📋TODO-list
